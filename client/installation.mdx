# Installation

The Graphora client library is designed to be easy to install and has minimal dependencies. This guide will walk you through the installation process and help you get set up quickly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installing with pip

The recommended way to install the Graphora client library is using pip:

```bash
pip install graphora
```

This will install the library and all its dependencies.

## Installing from source

If you prefer to install from source, you can clone the repository and install it using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/graphora/graphora-client.git
cd graphora-client
pip install -e .
```

## Dependencies

The Graphora client library has the following dependencies:

- `requests>=2.25.0` - For making HTTP requests to the Graphora API
- `pydantic>=1.8.0` - For data validation and settings management
- `pyyaml>=5.4.0` - For parsing YAML ontology files

These dependencies will be automatically installed when you install the library using pip.

## Verifying the installation

You can verify that the library is installed correctly by importing it in Python:

```python
import graphora

print(graphora.__version__)
# Should print: 0.4.1
```

This should print the version number of the installed library.

## Environment setup

The Graphora client library uses environment variables for configuration. You can set these variables in your environment or provide them directly when initializing the client.

### Required: Bearer token

All API calls require a Clerk-issued bearer token. Export it before making requests:

```bash
export GRAPHORA_AUTH_TOKEN="your-clerk-jwt"
```

Or provide it directly when initializing the client:

```python
import os
from graphora import GraphoraClient

client = GraphoraClient(
    auth_token=os.environ["GRAPHORA_AUTH_TOKEN"],
)
```

Passing `user_id` is optional and only used for local context; the backend derives identity from the JWT `sub` claim.

#### Pipelines / server-to-server workflows

Need to call Graphora from a CI job or data pipeline? Mint short-lived Clerk JWTs on demand—no extra Graphora code is required:

1. Create a Clerk user that represents the automation job and add a JWT template (e.g. `graphora_pipeline`) whose `aud` matches the Graphora API configuration.
2. When the job starts, request a token with your Clerk API key:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://api.clerk.com/v1/users/<USER_ID>/tokens/graphora_pipeline" \\
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLERK_API_KEY" \\
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
     -d '{"expires_in_seconds": 3600}'
   ```
3. Export the returned `token` as `GRAPHORA_AUTH_TOKEN` (or pass it directly to `GraphoraClient`). Rotate both the JWT and the Clerk API key regularly.

### API URL

By default, the client will connect to `GRAPHORA_API_URL` (or `https://api.graphora.io` if the variable is unset). Override it when targeting staging or a local docker stack:

```bash
export GRAPHORA_API_URL="https://api.graphora.io"
```

Or provide it directly when initializing the client:

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient

client = GraphoraClient(base_url="http://localhost:8000")
```

### Complete Environment Setup

Here's a complete example of setting up your environment:

```bash
# Required
export GRAPHORA_AUTH_TOKEN="your-clerk-jwt"

# Optional overrides
export GRAPHORA_API_URL="http://localhost:8000"
```

With these environment variables set, you can initialize the client with minimal parameters:

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient

client = GraphoraClient()
```
