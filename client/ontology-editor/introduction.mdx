# Ontology Editor

The Graphora Ontology Editor is a powerful tool for defining the structure, validation rules, and quality constraints of your knowledge graphs. It provides a comprehensive YAML-based format for describing entities, relationships, properties, and sophisticated quality validation rules.

## What You Can Define

### 1. **Entities & Properties**
Define the core building blocks of your knowledge graph with typed properties, constraints, and descriptions.

```yaml
entities:
  Company:
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        description: "Company legal name"
        required: true
        unique: true
      revenue:
        type: integer
        description: "Annual revenue in USD"
```

### 2. **Relationships**
Specify how entities connect to each other with cardinality constraints and relationship properties.

```yaml
relationships:
  ACQUIRED_BY:
    target: Company
    cardinality: manyToOne
    properties:
      acquisitionDate:
        type: string
        description: "Date of acquisition (YYYY-MM-DD)"
```

### 3. **Quality Rules**
Enforce data quality with comprehensive validation rules including format constraints, business rules, and automated quality scoring.

```yaml
quality:
  format:
    pattern: "^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\\s&.,-]+$"
    minLength: 2
    maxLength: 100
  business:
    forbiddenValues: ["Unknown", "N/A", "TBD"]
```

## Ontology Management Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design">
    Plan your ontology structure, identifying key entities, relationships, and business rules
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create">
    Use the YAML editor to define entities, properties, relationships, and quality rules
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate">
    Leverage real-time validation to ensure syntax correctness and schema compliance
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test">
    Validate your ontology against sample data to ensure it meets your requirements
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Register your ontology and use it for knowledge graph extraction and transformation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Getting Started

The ontology editor supports both simple ontology definitions and complex quality-aware schemas:

### Basic Ontology
Perfect for getting started with simple entity definitions:

```yaml
version: 1
entities:
  Person:
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        required: true
      age:
        type: integer
    relationships:
      WORKS_FOR:
        target: Company
```

### Quality-Aware Ontology  
Advanced schemas with comprehensive validation rules:

```yaml
version: 1
entities:
  Company:
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        required: true
        quality:
          format:
            pattern: "^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\\s&.,-]+$"
            minLength: 2
            maxLength: 100
          business:
            forbiddenValues: ["Unknown Company", "N/A", "TBD"]
```

## Quality Validation System

The ontology editor includes a sophisticated quality validation system that:

- **Scores** extracted data on a 0-100 scale with letter grades (A-F)
- **Validates** format rules like patterns, length, and case formatting
- **Enforces** business rules including allowed/forbidden values and ranges
- **Provides** detailed violation reports with context and suggestions
- **Enables** auto-approval for high-quality extractions

## API Integration

Ontologies created in the editor integrate seamlessly with the Graphora API:

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient

client = GraphoraClient(user_id="your-user-id")

# Register your ontology
ontology_response = client.register_ontology(ontology_yaml)

# Use it for transformation
transform_response = client.transform_document(
    file_path="document.pdf",
    ontology_id=ontology_response.id
)
```
