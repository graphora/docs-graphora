This simple ontology demonstrates:
- **Content management** basics with posts, authors, and tags
- **URL slug validation** for SEO-friendly URLs
- **Status workflow** for content publishing
- **Many-to-many tagging** system

## Best Practices Demonstrated

Across these examples, notice these patterns:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Naming Conventions" icon="tag">
    - **Entities**: PascalCase (`Company`, `BusinessSegment`)
    - **Properties**: camelCase (`employeeCount`, `filingDate`)  
    - **Relationships**: UPPER_CASE (`WORKS_FOR`, `HAS_SUBSIDIARY`)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Quality Rules" icon="shield-check">
    - **Required fields** for critical data
    - **Pattern validation** for structured data (emails, dates, codes)
    - **Business rules** to prevent common data quality issues
  </Card>
  <Card title="Relationship Design" icon="link">
    - **Clear cardinality** specifications
    - **Meaningful relationship names** that read naturally
    - **Relationship properties** for temporal and contextual data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Domain-Specific Rules" icon="building">
    - **Higher thresholds** for sensitive domains (healthcare: 85%)
    - **Industry-specific patterns** (CIK codes, ICD codes, ticker symbols)
    - **Controlled vocabularies** for categorical data
