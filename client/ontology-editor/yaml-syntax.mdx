# YAML Syntax Reference

This guide provides a comprehensive reference for the YAML syntax used to define ontologies in Graphora. The syntax is designed to be intuitive while supporting advanced features like quality rules and complex relationships.

## Basic Structure

Every Graphora ontology follows this basic structure:

```yaml
version: 1                    # Ontology version (required)
entities:                     # Entity definitions (required)
  EntityName:                 # Entity name (PascalCase recommended)
    properties:               # Entity properties (optional)
      propertyName:           # Property definitions
        type: string          # Property type (required)
        # ... additional property options
    relationships:            # Entity relationships (optional)
      RELATIONSHIP_NAME:      # Relationship name (UPPER_CASE recommended)
        target: TargetEntity  # Target entity (required)
        # ... additional relationship options
```

## Version Declaration

All ontologies must start with a version declaration:

```yaml
version: 1
```

<Note>
Currently, only version 1 is supported. This field is required for future compatibility.
</Note>

## Entity Definitions

Entities are the core building blocks of your ontology. Each entity represents a type of object in your domain.

### Entity Naming

- Use **PascalCase** for entity names (e.g., `Company`, `BusinessSegment`)
- Choose descriptive, singular nouns
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're widely understood

```yaml
entities:
  Company:           # ✅ Good: Clear, singular, PascalCase
    # ...
  BusinessSegment:   # ✅ Good: Descriptive compound name
    # ...
  Org:              # ⚠️ Avoid: Abbreviation unclear
    # ...
```

## Property Definitions

Properties define the attributes that entities can have. Each property has a type and optional constraints.

### Property Types

Graphora supports the following property types:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="string">
    Text data of any length
    ```yaml
    name:
      type: string
      description: "Company legal name"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="integer">
    Whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero)
    ```yaml
    employeeCount:
      type: integer
      description: "Number of full-time employees"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="float">
    Decimal numbers
    ```yaml
    revenue:
      type: float
      description: "Annual revenue in millions USD"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="boolean">
    True or false values
    ```yaml
    isPublic:
      type: boolean
      description: "Whether the company is publicly traded"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="date">
    Date values in YYYY-MM-DD format
    ```yaml
    founded_date:
      type: date
      description: "Company founding date"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Property Constraints

Properties can have various constraints to ensure data quality:

#### Required Properties

```yaml
name:
  type: string
  description: "Company legal name"
  required: true        # Property must have a non-null, non-empty value
```

#### Unique Properties

```yaml
cik:
  type: string
  description: "SEC Central Index Key"
  unique: true          # Property value must be unique across all entities
```

#### Indexed Properties

```yaml
industry:
  type: string
  description: "Primary industry classification"
  index: true           # Property will be indexed for fast searching
```

#### Combined Constraints

```yaml
ticker:
  type: string
  description: "Stock exchange ticker symbol"
  required: true        # Must have a value
  unique: true          # Must be unique
  index: true           # Will be indexed
```

### Complete Property Example

```yaml
entities:
  Company:
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        description: "Official company name"
        required: true
        unique: true
        index: true
      cik:
        type: string
        description: "SEC Central Index Key (10-digit identifier)"
        unique: true
      employeeCount:
        type: integer
        description: "Total number of employees"
      revenue:
        type: float
        description: "Annual revenue in millions USD"
      isPublic:
        type: boolean
        description: "Whether company is publicly traded"
      foundedDate:
        type: date
        description: "Date company was founded (YYYY-MM-DD)"
```

## Relationship Definitions

Relationships define how entities connect to each other in your knowledge graph.

### Relationship Naming

- Use **UPPER_CASE** with underscores (e.g., `WORKS_FOR`, `HAS_SUBSIDIARY`)
- Choose descriptive verb phrases
- Consider the direction: relationships are directional from source to target

```yaml
relationships:
  WORKS_FOR:           # ✅ Good: Clear verb phrase
    target: Company
  HAS_SUBSIDIARY:      # ✅ Good: Descriptive relationship
    target: Company
  REL_TO:             # ⚠️ Avoid: Unclear abbreviation
    target: Entity
```

### Basic Relationships

```yaml
entities:
  Person:
    relationships:
      WORKS_FOR:
        target: Company               # Target entity type
        description: "Employment relationship"  # Optional description
```

### Cardinality Constraints

Specify how many entities can be connected through a relationship:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="oneToOne">
    Each source entity connects to exactly one target entity
    ```yaml
    HAS_CEO:
      target: Person
      cardinality: oneToOne
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="oneToMany">
    Each source entity can connect to multiple target entities
    ```yaml
    HAS_EMPLOYEE:
      target: Person
      cardinality: oneToMany
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="manyToOne">
    Multiple source entities can connect to the same target entity
    ```yaml
    WORKS_FOR:
      target: Company
      cardinality: manyToOne
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="manyToMany">
    Multiple source entities can connect to multiple target entities
    ```yaml
    COMPETES_WITH:
      target: Company
      cardinality: manyToMany
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Relationship Properties
```yaml
entities:
  Person:
    relationships:
      WORKS_FOR:
        target: Company
        cardinality: manyToOne

Relationships can have their own properties to store additional information about the connection:

```yaml
entities:
  Person:
    relationships:
      WORKS_FOR:
        target: Company
        cardinality: manyToOne
        properties:
          startDate:
            type: date
            description: "Employment start date"
            required: true
          position:
            type: string
            description: "Job title or position"
          salary:
            type: float
            description: "Annual salary in USD"
          isActive:
            type: boolean
            description: "Whether employment is currently active"
            required: true
```

### Self-Referencing Relationships

Entities can have relationships to themselves:

```yaml
entities:
  Company:
    relationships:
      HAS_SUBSIDIARY:
        target: Company          # Self-reference
        cardinality: oneToMany
        description: "Parent-subsidiary relationship"
        properties:
          ownershipPercentage:
            type: float
            description: "Percentage ownership (0-100)"
          acquisitionDate:
            type: date
            description: "Date subsidiary was acquired"
```

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Target Relationships

While not directly supported in the syntax, you can model complex relationships using intermediate entities:

```yaml
entities:
  Person:
    relationships:
      HAS_ROLE:
        target: Role
        cardinality: oneToMany

  Role:
    properties:
      title:
        type: string
        required: true
    relationships:
      AT_COMPANY:
        target: Company
        cardinality: manyToOne
      IN_DEPARTMENT:
        target: Department
        cardinality: manyToOne
```

### Conditional Properties

Use descriptions to document business rules that should be enforced:

```yaml
entities:
  Company:
    properties:
      ticker:
        type: string
        description: "Stock ticker symbol (required only if isPublic is true)"
      marketCap:
        type: float
        description: "Market capitalization in USD (public companies only)"
```

## Validation Rules

The YAML syntax is validated for:

- **Syntax correctness**: Valid YAML format
- **Required fields**: Version, entities with proper structure
- **Type validity**: Supported property types only
- **Reference integrity**: Relationship targets must reference defined entities
- **Naming conventions**: Entity and relationship names follow recommended patterns

<Warning>
Invalid YAML syntax or missing required fields will prevent ontology registration. Use the real-time validation in the editor to catch errors early.
</Warning>
