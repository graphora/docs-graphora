# Document Transformation

Document transformation is the process of converting unstructured documents into structured graph data based on your ontology. This is a core capability of Graphora that allows you to extract meaningful entities and relationships from your documents.

## The Transformation Process

When you submit documents to Graphora for transformation, the following steps occur:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Document Upload">
    Documents are uploaded to the Graphora platform and validated.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Parsing">
    Documents are parsed into a format that can be processed by the extraction pipeline.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Entity Extraction">
    Entities defined in your ontology are identified and extracted from the documents.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Relationship Extraction">
    Relationships between entities are identified based on the ontology definitions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation">
    Extracted entities and relationships are validated against the ontology constraints.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Graph Construction">
    A graph is constructed from the validated entities and relationships.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Document Types

Graphora supports a variety of document types for transformation:

- **Text files** (`.txt`)
- **PDF documents** (`.pdf`)
- **PPT documents** (`.ppt`)
- **PPTX documents** (`.pptx`)
- **Word documents** (`.doc`)
- **Word documents** (`.docx`)
- **CSV files** (`.csv`)
- **JSON files** (`.json`)
- **YAML files** (`.yaml`)
- **XML files** (`.xml`)

## Transformation in the Client Library

The Graphora client library provides methods for transforming documents and monitoring the transformation process:

### Transforming Documents

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient
from graphora.models import DocumentMetadata, DocumentType

client = GraphoraClient(base_url="https://api.graphora.io")

# Create metadata for the files (optional)
metadata = [
    DocumentMetadata(
        source="company_info.txt",
        document_type=DocumentType.TXT,
        tags=["company", "example"],
        custom_metadata={"priority": "high"}
    )
]

# Transform documents
transform_response = client.transform(
    ontology_id="your-ontology-id",
    files=["document1.pdf", "document2.txt"],
    metadata=metadata
)

transform_id = transform_response.id
```

### Checking Transformation Status

```python
# Get the current status
status = client.get_transform_status(transform_id)
print(f"Status: {status.status}, Progress: {status.progress:.2%}")

# Or wait for completion
final_status = client.wait_for_transform(transform_id)
print(f"Final status: {final_status.status}")
```

### Retrieving the Transformed Graph

```python
# Get the resulting graph
graph = client.get_transformed_graph(transform_id=transform_id)
print(f"Graph has {len(graph.nodes)} nodes and {len(graph.edges)} edges")

# Print some node details
for node in graph.nodes[:3]:  # First 3 nodes
    print(f"Node {node.id}: {node.labels}")
    print(f"  Properties: {node.properties}")
```

## Transformation Stages

The transformation process goes through several stages, which you can monitor through the `stage_progress` field in the transformation status:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `UPLOAD` | Documents are being uploaded to the platform |
| `PARSING` | Documents are being parsed into a processable format |
| `EXTRACTION` | Entities and relationships are being extracted |
| `VALIDATION` | Extracted data is being validated against the ontology |
| `INDEXING` | Data is being indexed for efficient querying |
| `COMPLETED` | Transformation is complete |

## Handling Transformation Errors

If a transformation fails, you can check the `error` field in the transformation status:

```python
status = client.get_transform_status(transform_id)
if status.status == "FAILED":
    print(f"Transformation failed: {status.error}")
```

## Best Practices for Document Transformation

To get the best results from document transformation:

1. **Ensure your ontology is well-defined**: The quality of extraction depends on your ontology
2. **Use appropriate document types**: Different document types may yield different results
3. **Monitor transformation progress**: Long documents may take time to process
4. **Handle errors gracefully**: Check for and handle transformation errors
5. **Clean up after completion**: Use `cleanup_transform` to remove temporary files

## Example: Complete Transformation Workflow

Here's a complete example of transforming documents and handling the results:

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient
import time

client = GraphoraClient(base_url="https://api.graphora.io")

# Transform documents
transform_response = client.transform(
    ontology_id="your-ontology-id",
    files=["document1.pdf", "document2.txt"]
)
transform_id = transform_response.id
print(f"Transform ID: {transform_id}")

# Monitor progress
max_checks = 10
for i in range(max_checks):
    status = client.get_transform_status(transform_id)
    print(f"Status: {status.status}, Progress: {status.progress:.2%}")
    
    # Print stage progress
    for stage in status.stage_progress:
        print(f"  {stage.stage}: {stage.progress:.2%}")
    
    if status.status in ["COMPLETED", "FAILED"]:
        break
        
    if i < max_checks - 1:
        print("Waiting 5 seconds before checking again...")
        time.sleep(5)

# Handle completion or failure
if status.status == "COMPLETED":
    # Get the resulting graph
    graph = client.get_transformed_graph(transform_id=transform_id)
    print(f"Graph has {len(graph.nodes)} nodes and {len(graph.edges)} edges")
    
    # Process the graph...
    
elif status.status == "FAILED":
    print(f"Transformation failed: {status.error}")

# Clean up
client.cleanup_transform(transform_id)
```
