# Graph Merging

Graph merging is the process of integrating newly extracted graph data with existing data in your knowledge graph. This is a critical capability of Graphora that allows you to build and maintain a comprehensive knowledge graph over time.

## The Merging Process

When you merge transformed data into your knowledge graph, the following steps occur:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Entity Matching">
    Entities in the new data are matched against existing entities in the knowledge graph.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conflict Detection">
    Conflicts between new and existing data are identified (e.g., different values for the same property).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Resolution">
    Some conflicts are automatically resolved based on predefined rules and confidence scores.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Human Review">
    Conflicts that cannot be automatically resolved are flagged for human review.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Graph Integration">
    Resolved entities and relationships are integrated into the knowledge graph.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Index Update">
    Search indexes are updated to include the new data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Merging in the Client Library

The Graphora client library provides methods for merging transformed data and handling conflicts:

### Starting a Merge

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient

client = GraphoraClient(base_url="https://api.graphora.io")

# Start a merge process
merge_response = client.start_merge(
    session_id="your-ontology-id",  # Session ID is the ontology ID
    transform_id="your-transform-id"
)

merge_id = merge_response.merge_id
```

### Checking Merge Status

```python
# Get the current status
status = client.get_merge_status(merge_id)
print(f"Status: {status.status}, Progress: {status.progress:.2%}")
print(f"Conflicts: {status.conflicts_count}, Resolved: {status.resolved_count}")
```

### Handling Conflicts

```python
# Get conflicts that need resolution
conflicts = client.get_conflicts(merge_id)

for conflict in conflicts:
    print(f"Conflict ID: {conflict.id}")
    print(f"Entity ID: {conflict.entity_id}")
    print(f"Entity Type: {conflict.entity_type}")
    print(f"Conflict Type: {conflict.conflict_type}")
    
    # Resolve the conflict
    client.resolve_conflict(
        merge_id=merge_id,
        conflict_id=conflict.id,
        changed_props={},  # No property changes in this example
        resolution="accept",  # Or "reject", "modify", "merge"
        learning_comment="Accepting this entity"
    )
```

### Retrieving the Merged Graph

```python
# Get the merged graph
graph = client.get_merged_graph(merge_id=merge_id, transform_id="your-transform-id")
print(f"Graph has {len(graph.nodes)} nodes and {len(graph.edges)} edges")
```

## Conflict Resolution Strategies

When resolving conflicts, you can use one of the following strategies:

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ACCEPT` | Accept the new data, replacing the existing data |
| `REJECT` | Reject the new data, keeping the existing data |
| `MODIFY` | Modify the data before accepting it |
| `MERGE` | Merge the new and existing data |

## Merge Statistics

You can get detailed statistics about a merge operation:

```python
# Get merge statistics
statistics = client.get_merge_statistics(merge_id)
print("Merge Statistics:")
for key, value in statistics.items():
    print(f"  {key}: {value}")
```

The statistics include information such as:
- Number of entities processed
- Number of relationships processed
- Number of conflicts detected
- Number of conflicts resolved automatically
- Number of conflicts resolved manually
- Time taken for each stage of the merge process

## Best Practices for Graph Merging

To get the best results from graph merging:

1. **Define clear entity matching rules**: Ensure entities are correctly matched across datasets
2. **Handle conflicts appropriately**: Choose the right resolution strategy for each conflict
3. **Provide meaningful learning comments**: Help improve automatic resolution over time
4. **Monitor merge progress**: Large merges may take time to complete
5. **Review merge statistics**: Understand how your data is being integrated

## Example: Complete Merge Workflow

Here's a complete example of merging transformed data and handling conflicts:

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient
from graphora.models import ResolutionStrategy
import time

client = GraphoraClient(base_url="https://api.graphora.io")

# Start the merge process
merge_response = client.start_merge(
    session_id="your-ontology-id",
    transform_id="your-transform-id"
)
merge_id = merge_response.merge_id
print(f"Merge process started with merge ID: {merge_id}")

# Monitor the merge process
max_checks = 10
for i in range(max_checks):
    status = client.get_merge_status(merge_id)
    print(f"Status: {status.status}, Progress: {status.progress:.2%}")
    print(f"Conflicts: {status.conflicts_count}, Resolved: {status.resolved_count}")
    
    if status.status in ["COMPLETED", "FAILED"]:
        break
        
    if i < max_checks - 1:
        print("Waiting 5 seconds before checking again...")
        time.sleep(5)

# Check for conflicts
conflicts = client.get_conflicts(merge_id)

if conflicts:
    print(f"Found {len(conflicts)} conflicts that need resolution")
    
    # Resolve each conflict
    for i, conflict in enumerate(conflicts):
        print(f"\nResolving conflict {i+1}/{len(conflicts)}")
        print(f"Conflict ID: {conflict.id}")
        print(f"Entity ID: {conflict.entity_id}")
        print(f"Entity Type: {conflict.entity_type}")
        print(f"Conflict Type: {conflict.conflict_type}")
        
        if conflict.suggested_resolution:
            print(f"Suggested Resolution: {conflict.suggested_resolution}")
            print(f"Confidence: {conflict.confidence:.2%}")
        
        # In a real application, you might want to ask the user for input
        # Here we'll just accept the suggested resolution or use ACCEPT as default
        resolution = conflict.suggested_resolution or ResolutionStrategy.ACCEPT
        
        print(f"Applying resolution: {resolution}")
        result = client.resolve_conflict(
            merge_id=merge_id,
            conflict_id=conflict.id,
            changed_props={},  # No property changes in this example
            resolution=resolution,
            learning_comment=f"Auto-resolved with {resolution}"
        )
        
        if result:
            print("Conflict resolved successfully")
        else:
            print("Failed to resolve conflict")
else:
    print("No conflicts found")

# Get merge statistics
print("\nGetting merge statistics...")
statistics = client.get_merge_statistics(merge_id)
print("Merge Statistics:")
for key, value in statistics.items():
    print(f"  {key}: {value}")

# Get the merged graph
print("\nRetrieving the merged graph...")
graph = client.get_merged_graph(merge_id=merge_id, transform_id="your-transform-id")
print(f"Graph retrieved with {len(graph.nodes)} nodes and {len(graph.edges)} edges")
```
