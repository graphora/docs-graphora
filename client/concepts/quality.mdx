# Quality Validation

Quality validation is a critical component of Graphora's knowledge graph generation pipeline. It ensures that extracted data meets your business requirements and maintains high standards before being merged into production databases.

## Overview

Graphora's quality validation system automatically evaluates extracted knowledge graphs against predefined rules and standards, providing comprehensive feedback about data quality, completeness, and correctness.

### Key Benefits

- **Automated Quality Assessment**: Systematic evaluation of extracted data
- **Comprehensive Scoring**: 0-100 scale with letter grades (A-F)
- **Detailed Violation Reports**: Entity and property-level feedback
- **Business Rule Validation**: Custom domain-specific checks
- **Quality-Driven Workflows**: Approval/rejection based on quality thresholds

---

## Quality Metrics

### Overall Quality Score

The system provides an overall quality score from 0-100 with corresponding letter grades:

- **A (90-100)**: Excellent quality, ready for production
- **B (80-89)**: Good quality, minor issues acceptable
- **C (70-79)**: Average quality, review recommended
- **D (60-69)**: Below average, significant issues present
- **F (0-59)**: Poor quality, requires attention

### Detailed Metrics

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient

client = GraphoraClient(base_url="https://api.graphora.io", user_id="user-123")
results = client.get_quality_results("transform-123")

print(f"Overall Score: {results.overall_score:.1f}/100")
print(f"Grade: {results.grade}")
print(f"Property Completeness: {results.metrics.property_completeness_rate:.1f}%")
print(f"Rules Applied: {results.rules_applied}")
print(f"Total Violations: {len(results.violations)}")
```

## Quality Rule Types

### Format Rules

Validate data types, formats, and structural requirements:

- **Data Type Validation**: Ensure properties match expected types (string, integer, date)
- **Format Compliance**: Validate patterns like email addresses, phone numbers, URLs
- **Range Validation**: Check numeric values fall within acceptable ranges
- **Length Constraints**: Verify string lengths meet requirements

**Example Format Rules**:
```yaml
entities:
  Company:
    properties:
      email:
        type: string
        format: email
        required: true
      foundedYear:
        type: integer
        minimum: 1800
        maximum: 2024
```

### Business Rules

Domain-specific validation based on your business logic:

- **Uniqueness Constraints**: Ensure unique identifiers are truly unique
- **Relationship Validation**: Verify relationships make business sense
- **Cross-Entity Validation**: Check consistency across related entities
- **Custom Logic**: Apply domain-specific business rules

**Example Business Rules**:
```yaml
entities:
  Person:
    properties:
      birthDate:
        type: date
        businessRules:
          - name: "realistic_birth_date"
            description: "Birth date should be within realistic human lifespan"
            validation: "birthDate >= '1900-01-01' AND birthDate <= today()"
```

### Completeness Rules

Ensure required information is present and complete:

- **Required Properties**: Validate all mandatory fields are populated
- **Relationship Completeness**: Check required relationships exist
- **Coverage Analysis**: Assess what percentage of expected data is present
- **Missing Data Detection**: Identify gaps in the knowledge graph

### Consistency Rules

Maintain data consistency across the knowledge graph:

- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure referenced entities exist
- **Temporal Consistency**: Validate date and time relationships
- **Hierarchical Consistency**: Check parent-child relationships
- **Constraint Validation**: Enforce complex multi-entity constraints

## Quality Violations

### Violation Severity Levels

Quality violations are categorized by severity:

#### Error (High Severity)
- **Impact**: Critical issues that prevent data usage
- **Examples**: Missing required properties, invalid data types, broken relationships
- **Recommendation**: Must be fixed before proceeding

#### Warning (Medium Severity)
- **Impact**: Issues that may affect data quality but don't prevent usage
- **Examples**: Missing optional properties, format inconsistencies
- **Recommendation**: Should be reviewed and potentially fixed

#### Info (Low Severity)
- **Impact**: Minor issues or suggestions for improvement
- **Examples**: Optimization suggestions, style inconsistencies
- **Recommendation**: Optional improvements

### Violation Details

Each violation provides comprehensive information:

```python
from graphora.models import QualitySeverity

# Get error-level violations
error_violations = client.get_quality_violations(
    transform_id="transform-123",
    severity=QualitySeverity.ERROR,
    limit=10
)

for violation in error_violations.violations:
    print(f"Entity: {violation.entity_type} (ID: {violation.entity_id})")
    print(f"Property: {violation.property_name}")
    print(f"Message: {violation.message}")
    print(f"Expected: {violation.expected}")
    print(f"Actual: {violation.actual}")
    if violation.suggestion:
        print(f"Suggestion: {violation.suggestion}")
```

---

## Quality-Driven Workflows

### Approval Thresholds

Configure quality thresholds for different approval workflows:

```python
# High-quality data - auto-approve
if results.overall_score >= 90 and results.violations_by_severity.get('error', 0) == 0:
    approval = client.approve_quality_results(
        transform_id="transform-123",
        approval_comment="High quality - auto approved"
    )

# Moderate quality - manual review
elif results.overall_score >= 70:
    print("Manual review required")
    # Present violations to user for decision

# Low quality - reject
else:
    rejection = client.reject_quality_results(
        transform_id="transform-123",
        rejection_reason="Quality too low for production use"
    )
```

### Feedback Loop

Quality validation supports continuous improvement through feedback:

1. **Approval with Comments**: Explain acceptance decisions
2. **Rejection with Reasons**: Detail what needs improvement
3. **Learning Comments**: Provide context for future processing
4. **Rule Refinement**: Adjust quality rules based on feedback

---

## Quality Configuration

### Rule Definition in Ontology

Quality rules are defined directly in your ontology YAML:

```yaml
version: 1
qualityRules:
  formatRules:
    - name: "email_format"
      description: "Email addresses must be valid"
      entityType: "Person"
      propertyName: "email"
      ruleType: "format"
      severity: "error"
      validation:
        format: "email"
    
  businessRules:
    - name: "company_name_uniqueness"
      description: "Company names must be unique"
      entityType: "Company"
      propertyName: "name"
      ruleType: "business"
      severity: "error"
      validation:
        unique: true

  completenessRules:
    - name: "required_properties"
      description: "All required properties must be present"
      ruleType: "completeness"
      severity: "error"
      entityLevel: true
```

### Dynamic Rule Application

Quality rules are applied dynamically based on your ontology:

- **Entity-Specific Rules**: Applied only to specific entity types
- **Property-Specific Rules**: Target individual properties
- **Global Rules**: Applied across all entities
- **Conditional Rules**: Applied based on specific conditions

---

## Quality API Usage

### Basic Quality Workflow

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient
from graphora.exceptions import GraphoraAPIError

client = GraphoraClient(base_url="https://api.graphora.io", user_id="user-123")

try:
    # 1. Get quality results after transformation
    results = client.get_quality_results("transform-123")
    
    # 2. Analyze quality metrics
    print(f"Quality Score: {results.overall_score:.1f}")
    print(f"Grade: {results.grade}")
    
    # 3. Review violations by severity
    for severity, count in results.violations_by_severity.items():
        print(f"{severity}: {count} violations")
    
    # 4. Make quality decision
    if results.requires_review:
        # Get detailed violations for review
        violations = client.get_quality_violations(
            transform_id="transform-123",
            severity="error"
        )
        
        # Review and decide
        # ... decision logic ...
        
        # Approve or reject
        if decision == "approve":
            client.approve_quality_results(
                transform_id="transform-123",
                approval_comment="Acceptable quality for production"
            )
        else:
            client.reject_quality_results(
                transform_id="transform-123",
                rejection_reason="Too many critical errors"
            )
    
except GraphoraAPIError as e:
    print(f"Quality validation error: {e}")
```

### Advanced Quality Analysis

```python
# Get quality summary for user
summary = client.get_quality_summary(limit=10)
for result in summary.recent_quality_results:
    print(f"Transform: {result['transform_id']}")
    print(f"Score: {result['overall_score']}")
    print(f"Status: {result['status']}")

# Filter violations by type and entity
format_violations = client.get_quality_violations(
    transform_id="transform-123",
    violation_type="format",
    entity_type="Company",
    limit=50
)

# Check quality service health
health = client.get_quality_health()
if not health.quality_api_available:
    print("Quality validation service is unavailable")
```

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic format and required field rules
2. **Iterate Gradually**: Add business rules based on real data patterns
3. **Balance Strictness**: Avoid overly restrictive rules that reject good data
4. **Document Rules**: Provide clear descriptions for all quality rules

### Quality Thresholds

1. **Environment-Specific**: Use different thresholds for staging vs. production
2. **Data-Type Aware**: Adjust thresholds based on data complexity
3. **Business Aligned**: Set thresholds that match business requirements
4. **Monitor Trends**: Track quality improvements over time

### Violation Management

1. **Prioritize Errors**: Always address error-level violations first
2. **Review Warnings**: Assess warning-level violations for business impact
3. **Track Patterns**: Identify recurring violation types for rule refinement
4. **Provide Feedback**: Use detailed feedback to improve future processing

### Continuous Improvement

1. **Regular Review**: Periodically review quality rules and thresholds
2. **Feedback Analysis**: Analyze approval/rejection patterns
