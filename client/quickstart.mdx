# Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you get started with the Graphora client library, showing you how to perform common operations with code examples.

## Installation

First, install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install graphora
```

## Authentication

To use the Graphora API, you'll need an API key and a user ID. The user ID is required to scope all API operations to your account. You can provide these credentials in several ways:

<CodeGroup>
```python Direct initialization
from graphora import GraphoraClient

client = GraphoraClient(
    base_url="https://api.graphora.io",
    user_id="your-user-id",  # Required
    api_key="your-api-key"
)
```

```python Environment variables
# Set the environment variables
# export GRAPHORA_USER_ID="your-user-id"
# export GRAPHORA_API_KEY="your-api-key"

from graphora import GraphoraClient

client = GraphoraClient(base_url="https://api.graphora.io")
```

```python Mixed approach
# Set API key as environment variable
# export GRAPHORA_API_KEY="your-api-key"

from graphora import GraphoraClient

client = GraphoraClient(
    base_url="https://api.graphora.io",
    user_id="your-user-id"  # user_id provided directly
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Basic Workflow

The typical workflow for using Graphora involves:

1. Defining an ontology
2. Uploading documents for processing
3. Monitoring the transformation process
4. Merging the extracted data
5. Querying the resulting graph

Let's walk through each step with code examples.

### 1. Define and Upload an Ontology

An ontology defines the structure of your knowledge graph, including entity types and their relationships.

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient

# Initialize client with user ID (required)
client = GraphoraClient(
    base_url="https://api.graphora.io",
    user_id="your-user-id",  # Required for all API calls
    api_key="your-api-key"   # Or set GRAPHORA_API_KEY environment variable
)

# Load ontology from a file
with open("ontology.yaml", "r") as f:
    ontology_yaml = f.read()

# Register and validate the ontology
ontology_response = client.register_ontology(ontology_yaml)
ontology_id = ontology_response.id
print(f"Ontology ID: {ontology_id}")
```

### 2. Upload Documents for Processing

Once you have an ontology, you can upload documents to be processed according to that ontology.

```python
# Upload documents for processing
transform_response = client.transform(
    ontology_id=ontology_id,
    files=["document1.pdf", "document2.txt"]
)

transform_id = transform_response.id
print(f"Transform ID: {transform_id}")
```

### 3. Monitor the Transformation Process

Transforming documents is an asynchronous process. You can check the status or wait for completion.

<CodeGroup>
```python Check status
# Check status
status = client.get_transform_status(transform_id)
print(f"Status: {status.status}, Progress: {status.progress:.2%}")
```

```python Wait for completion
# Wait for completion
final_status = client.wait_for_transform(transform_id)
print(f"Final status: {final_status.status}")
```
</CodeGroup>

### 4. Get the Transformed Graph

After transformation, you can retrieve the resulting graph.

```python
# Get the graph
graph = client.get_transformed_graph(transform_id=transform_id)

# Print summary
print(f"Nodes: {len(graph.nodes)}")
print(f"Edges: {len(graph.edges)}")

# Print node details
for node in graph.nodes[:5]:  # First 5 nodes
    print(f"Node {node.id}: {node.labels} - {node.properties}")
```

### 5. Merge the Extracted Data

You can merge the extracted data into your knowledge graph.

```python
# Start merge process
merge_response = client.start_merge(
    session_id=ontology_id,
    transform_id=transform_id
)

merge_id = merge_response.merge_id
print(f"Merge ID: {merge_id}")
```

### 6. Check for Conflicts

During the merge process, there might be conflicts that need resolution.

```python
# Check for conflicts
conflicts = client.get_conflicts(merge_id)
if conflicts:
    print(f"Found {len(conflicts)} conflicts")
    
    # Resolve a conflict
    for conflict in conflicts:
        client.resolve_conflict(
            merge_id=merge_id,
            conflict_id=conflict.id,
            changed_props={},
            resolution="accept",
            learning_comment="Accepting this entity"
        )
```

### 7. Get the Merged Graph

Finally, you can retrieve the merged graph.

```python
# Get the merged graph
merged_graph = client.get_merged_graph(merge_id=merge_id, transform_id=transform_id)
print(f"Merged graph has {len(merged_graph.nodes)} nodes and {len(merged_graph.edges)} edges")
```

## Complete Example

Here's a complete example that ties all these steps together:

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient
import time

# Initialize client with user ID (required)
client = GraphoraClient(
    base_url="https://api.graphora.io",
    user_id="your-user-id",  # Required: User ID for all API calls
    api_key="your-api-key"   # Or set GRAPHORA_API_KEY environment variable
)

# Load and upload ontology
with open("ontology.yaml", "r") as f:
    ontology_yaml = f.read()
    
ontology_response = client.register_ontology(ontology_yaml)
ontology_id = ontology_response.id
print(f"Ontology ID: {ontology_id}")

# Upload documents for processing
transform_response = client.transform(
    ontology_id=ontology_id,
    files=["document1.pdf", "document2.txt"]
)
transform_id = transform_response.id
print(f"Transform ID: {transform_id}")

# Wait for transformation to complete
final_status = client.wait_for_transform(transform_id)
print(f"Transformation completed with status: {final_status.status}")

# Get the transformed graph
graph = client.get_transformed_graph(transform_id=transform_id)
print(f"Graph has {len(graph.nodes)} nodes and {len(graph.edges)} edges")

# Start merge process
merge_response = client.start_merge(
    session_id=ontology_id,
    transform_id=transform_id
)
merge_id = merge_response.merge_id
print(f"Merge ID: {merge_id}")

# Wait for merge to complete (simple polling)
for _ in range(30):  # Try for 5 minutes
    status = client.get_merge_status(merge_id)
    if status.status in ["COMPLETED", "FAILED"]:
        break
    print(f"Merge status: {status.status}, Progress: {status.progress:.2%}")
    time.sleep(10)

# Get conflicts if any
conflicts = client.get_conflicts(merge_id)
if conflicts:
    print(f"Found {len(conflicts)} conflicts")
    
    # Resolve conflicts
    for conflict in conflicts:
        client.resolve_conflict(
            merge_id=merge_id,
            conflict_id=conflict.id,
            changed_props={},
            resolution="accept",
            learning_comment="Accepting this entity"
        )

# Get the final merged graph
merged_graph = client.get_merged_graph(merge_id=merge_id, transform_id=transform_id)
print(f"Final merged graph has {len(merged_graph.nodes)} nodes and {len(merged_graph.edges)} edges")
```
