# Merging Examples

This page provides practical examples of merging extracted data into knowledge graphs using the Graphora client library.

## Basic Merging Operation

After transforming documents, you can merge the extracted data into a knowledge graph:

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient

# Initialize the client with user ID (required)
client = GraphoraClient(
    base_url="https://api.graphora.io",
    user_id="your-user-id",  # Required for all API calls
    api_key="your-api-key"
)

# Use a previously completed transformation
session_id = "ont_123456789"  # Ontology ID
transform_id = "transform_123456789"

# Start the merging process
merge_response = client.start_merge(session_id, transform_id)
print(f"Merge started with ID: {merge_response.merge_id}")

# Check the status of the merge
status = client.get_merge_status(merge_response.merge_id)
print(f"Merge status: {status.status}")
print(f"Progress: {status.progress:.2%}")
```

## Monitoring Merge Progress

For large datasets, merging can take some time. Here's how to monitor the progress:

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient
import time

# Initialize the client with user ID (required)
client = GraphoraClient(
    base_url="https://api.graphora.io",
    user_id="your-user-id",  # Required for all API calls
    api_key="your-api-key"
)

# Start a merge (assuming you have already completed a transformation)
session_id = "ont_123456789"  # Ontology ID
transform_id = "transform_123456789"
merge_response = client.start_merge(session_id, transform_id)
merge_id = merge_response.merge_id

# Monitor the merge progress
completed = False
while not completed:
    status = client.get_merge_status(merge_id)
    print(f"Status: {status.status}, Progress: {status.progress:.2%}")
    
    if status.status in ["COMPLETED", "FAILED"]:
        completed = True
        if status.status == "COMPLETED":
            print("Merge completed successfully!")
        else:
            print(f"Merge failed: {status.error}")
    else:
        # Wait for 5 seconds before checking again
        time.sleep(5)

# If merge was successful, you can retrieve the graph data
if status.status == "COMPLETED":
    graph = client.get_merged_graph(merge_id, transform_id)
    print(f"Retrieved graph with {len(graph.nodes)} nodes and {len(graph.edges)} edges")
```

## Handling Merge Conflicts

When merging data, conflicts may arise. Here's how to handle them:

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient

# Initialize the client with user ID (required)
client = GraphoraClient(
    base_url="https://api.graphora.io",
    user_id="your-user-id",  # Required for all API calls
    api_key="your-api-key"
)

# Get conflicts for a merge that has detected conflicts
merge_id = "merge_123456789"
conflicts = client.get_conflicts(merge_id)

print(f"Found {len(conflicts)} conflicts")

# Resolve each conflict
for conflict in conflicts:
    print(f"Conflict ID: {conflict.id}")
    print(f"Entity Type: {conflict.entity_type}")
    print(f"Entity ID: {conflict.entity_id}")
    print(f"Conflicting Properties: {conflict.properties}")
    
    # Example: Resolve by accepting the conflict
    changed_props = {}  # You can modify specific properties here
    
    # Add a learning comment to improve future conflict resolution
    learning_comment = "Accepting this entity as it appears to be accurate"
    
    # Resolve the conflict
    success = client.resolve_conflict(
        merge_id, 
        conflict.id, 
        changed_props, 
        "accept",  # Resolution strategy
        learning_comment
    )
    
    if success:
        print(f"Resolved conflict {conflict.id}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to resolve conflict {conflict.id}")
```

## Getting Merge Statistics

You can get detailed statistics about a merge operation:

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient

# Initialize the client with user ID (required)
client = GraphoraClient(
    base_url="https://api.graphora.io",
    user_id="your-user-id",  # Required for all API calls
    api_key="your-api-key"
)

# Get merge statistics
merge_id = "merge_123456789"
stats = client.get_merge_statistics(merge_id)

print("Merge Statistics:")
print(f"Total entities processed: {stats.get('total_entities', 0)}")
print(f"Entities merged: {stats.get('merged_entities', 0)}")
print(f"New entities created: {stats.get('new_entities', 0)}")
print(f"Conflicts detected: {stats.get('conflicts_detected', 0)}")
print(f"Conflicts resolved: {stats.get('conflicts_resolved', 0)}")
```

## Retrieving and Using the Merged Graph

Once a merge is complete, you can retrieve and use the graph data:

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient

# Initialize the client with user ID (required)
client = GraphoraClient(
    base_url="https://api.graphora.io",
    user_id="your-user-id",  # Required for all API calls
    api_key="your-api-key"
)

# Get the merged graph
merge_id = "merge_123456789"
transform_id = "transform_123456789"
graph_response = client.get_merged_graph(merge_id, transform_id)

# Print some statistics
print(f"Graph contains {len(graph_response.nodes)} nodes and {len(graph_response.edges)} edges")

# Examine nodes
for node in graph_response.nodes[:5]:  # First 5 nodes
    print(f"Node {node.id}: {node.labels} - {node.properties}")

# Examine edges
for edge in graph_response.edges[:5]:  # First 5 edges
    print(f"Edge {edge.id}: {edge.source} -> {edge.target} ({edge.type})")
```

These examples demonstrate the basic operations for merging data with the Graphora client library. For more detailed information about merging concepts and options, see the [Merging Concepts](/client/concepts/merging) page.
