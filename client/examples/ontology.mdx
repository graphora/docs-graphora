# Ontology Examples

This page provides practical examples of working with ontologies in the Graphora client library.

## Creating and Registering an Ontology

The following example demonstrates how to create an ontology definition and register it with Graphora:

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient

# Initialize the client
client = GraphoraClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Define your ontology
ontology_yaml = """
version: 1
entities:
  Person:
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        unique: true
        required: true
      age:
        type: integer
      email:
        type: string
        index: true
    relationships:
      works_at:
        target: Company
        cardinality: many_to_one
      knows:
        target: Person
        cardinality: many_to_many
  
  Company:
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        unique: true
        required: true
      industry:
        type: string
      founded_year:
        type: integer
    relationships:
      has_subsidiary:
        target: Company
        cardinality: one_to_many
"""

# Register the ontology
response = client.register_ontology(ontology_yaml)
print(f"Ontology registered with ID: {response.ontology_id}")
```

## Loading an Ontology from a File

You can also load an ontology from a YAML file:

```python
import os
from graphora import GraphoraClient
from graphora.utils import load_yaml

# Initialize the client
client = GraphoraClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Load the ontology from a file
ontology_path = os.path.join("path", "to", "ontology.yaml")
ontology_yaml = load_yaml(ontology_path)

# Register the ontology
response = client.register_ontology(ontology_yaml)
print(f"Ontology registered with ID: {response.ontology_id}")
```

## Validating an Ontology

Before registering an ontology, you might want to validate it locally:

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient
from graphora.models import Ontology
from pydantic import ValidationError

# Define your ontology
ontology_yaml = """
version: 1
entities:
  Person:
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
      age:
        type: integer
"""

try:
    # Parse and validate the ontology
    ontology = Ontology.parse_yaml(ontology_yaml)
    print("Ontology is valid!")
    
    # Now you can register it
    client = GraphoraClient(api_key="your_api_key")
    response = client.register_ontology(ontology_yaml)
    print(f"Ontology registered with ID: {response.ontology_id}")
    
except ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Ontology validation failed: {e}")
```

## Updating an Existing Ontology

To update an existing ontology, you can use the same `register_ontology` method with an updated definition:

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient

# Initialize the client
client = GraphoraClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Define your updated ontology
updated_ontology_yaml = """
version: 2
entities:
  Person:
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        unique: true
        required: true
      age:
        type: integer
      email:
        type: string
        index: true
      phone:  # New property added
        type: string
    relationships:
      works_at:
        target: Company
        cardinality: many_to_one
      knows:
        target: Person
        cardinality: many_to_many
  
  Company:
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        unique: true
        required: true
      industry:
        type: string
      founded_year:
        type: integer
      website:  # New property added
        type: string
    relationships:
      has_subsidiary:
        target: Company
        cardinality: one_to_many
"""

# Register the updated ontology
response = client.register_ontology(updated_ontology_yaml)
print(f"Updated ontology registered with ID: {response.ontology_id}")
```

These examples demonstrate the basic operations you can perform with ontologies in the Graphora client library. For more detailed information about ontology structure and options, see the [Ontology Concepts](/client/concepts/ontology) page.
