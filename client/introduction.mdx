# Graphora Client Library

The Graphora Client Library provides a simple and intuitive Python interface to the Graphora API, enabling you to easily integrate Graphora's graph-based data processing capabilities into your applications and data pipelines.

## Overview

Graphora is a powerful graph-based data processing platform that enables you to:

- Transform unstructured data into structured knowledge graphs
- Define custom ontologies for your domain
- Extract entities and relationships from documents
- Merge and manage graph data
- Query and analyze connected data

This client library makes it easy to integrate Graphora into your data pipelines, including platforms like Apache Beam, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow.

## Installation

The Graphora client library can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install graphora
```

## Quick Example

Here's a simple example of using the Graphora client library to upload an ontology and transform documents:

```python
from graphora import GraphoraClient

# Initialize client
client = GraphoraClient(
    base_url="https://api.graphora.io",
    api_key="your-api-key"  # Or set GRAPHORA_API_KEY environment variable
)

# Register an ontology
with open("ontology.yaml", "r") as f:
    ontology_yaml = f.read()
    
ontology_response = client.register_ontology(ontology_yaml)
ontology_id = ontology_response.id

# Transform documents
transform_response = client.transform(
    ontology_id=ontology_id,
    files=["document1.pdf", "document2.txt"]
)

# Wait for processing to complete
transform_status = client.wait_for_transform(transform_response.id)

# Get the resulting graph
graph = client.get_transformed_graph(transform_id=transform_response.id)
print(f"Nodes: {len(graph.nodes)}")
print(f"Edges: {len(graph.edges)}")
```
