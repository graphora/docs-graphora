# Graphora API Reference

The Graphora API provides programmatic access to the Graphora platform, allowing you to manage ontologies, transform documents, and work with knowledge graphs. This reference documents the endpoints available in the Graphora API.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.graphora.io/api/v1
```

## Authentication

The Graphora API uses API keys for authentication. You can obtain an API key from the [Graphora Dashboard](https://app.graphora.io/settings/api-keys).

To authenticate your requests, include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Note>
  Keep your API keys secure and do not share them in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, etc.
</Note>

## API Endpoints

The Graphora API is organized around the following main resources:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Ontology"
    icon="sitemap"
  >
    Create, retrieve, and manage ontologies
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Transform"
    icon="file-lines"
  >
    Upload and process documents
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Merge"
    icon="code-merge"
  >
    Merge extracted data into knowledge graphs
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Graph"
    icon="diagram-project"
  >
    Query and manipulate graph data
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Client Libraries

While you can use the API directly with HTTP requests, we recommend using our client libraries for a more convenient experience:

<Card
  title="Python Client Library"
  icon="python"
  href="/client/introduction"
>
  Use the Graphora client library in your Python applications
</Card>

## Rate Limits

The Graphora API has rate limits to ensure fair usage and system stability. The current limits are:

- 100 requests per minute per API key
- 5,000 requests per day per API key

If you exceed these limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
