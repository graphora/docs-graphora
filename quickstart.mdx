# Graphora Platform Quickstart

This guide will help you get started with the Graphora platform. For the client library quickstart, please see the [Client Library Quickstart](/client/quickstart) guide.

## Overview

Graphora is a knowledge graph platform that helps you extract structured information from unstructured data. The platform consists of several components:

1. **Ontology Management**: Define the structure of your knowledge graph
2. **Document Processing**: Transform documents into structured data
3. **Graph Management**: Query and manipulate your knowledge graph
4. **Client Library**: Integrate Graphora into your applications

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account">
    To get started with Graphora, you'll need to create an account. Visit [https://app.graphora.io/signup](https://app.graphora.io/signup) to sign up.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first ontology">
    After signing in, create your first ontology by defining the entities and relationships you want to extract from your documents.

    ```yaml
    version: 0.1.0
    entities:
      Company:
        properties:
          name:
            type: str
            description: Name of the Company
            unique: true
            required: true
          industry:
            type: str
            description: Industry sector
        relationships:
          HAS_PRODUCT:
            target: Product
      Product:
        properties:
          name:
            type: str
            description: Product name
            unique: true
            required: true
    ```

    Save this ontology with a meaningful name, such as "Company Products".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload documents">
    Upload documents containing information about companies and their products. Graphora supports various document formats including PDF, DOCX, TXT, and more.

    Navigate to the Documents section and click "Upload" to select your files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process documents">
    After uploading, select the documents you want to process and choose the ontology you created. Click "Process" to start the transformation.

    Graphora will extract entities and relationships according to your ontology definition.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore your knowledge graph">
    Once processing is complete, you can explore your knowledge graph in the Graph Explorer. You'll see the companies and products extracted from your documents, along with their relationships.

    Use the query interface to search for specific entities or relationships.
  </Step>
</Steps>
